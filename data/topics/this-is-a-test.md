<h1 style="font-size:20px;color:blue;text-align:center;font-family:'Times New Roman'"> "The word “Gwich’in” means “people of the land,” and it refers to a people who have lived in the region since before the U.S. and Canada existed."</h1>

The Gwich’in are a nation of Athabaskan speaking peoples that are indigenous to the land in the far north, and live among 15 villages in the white settler states of Alaska, the Yukon, and the Northwest Territories. The name Gwich’in means ‘people of the land,’ and refers to the land that the Gwich’in have occupied for at least the last 20,000 years. The Gwich’in people call themselves ‘the Caribou people’ because of the deep spiritual connection that they share with Caribou and the Porcupine Caribou Herd. The Gwich’in are currently fighting against oil drilling projects in the Arctic National Refuge that are a serious danger to the lives of the Gwich’in, the caribou, and other wildlife and the ecosystem of the region.

##### **“We are caribou people.  Caribou are not just what we eat; they are who we are.  They are in our stories and songs and the whole way we see the world.  Caribou are our life.  Without caribou we wouldn’t exist”.  ~Sarah James** (<https://ourarcticrefuge.org/about-the-gwichin/>)

“Our Identity is non Negotiable” discusses how drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) would impact the native communities who live in the region, particularly the Gwich’in tribe that has, for generations, relied on the migratory caribou herd that births and calves its young in the coastal plains of the ANWR. In an interview with Mongabay, Gwich’in leader Bernadette Demientieff describes the cultural and historical significance of the Porcupine caribou to the Gwich’in, her role in the campaign against drilling in the ANWR, and the impacts of energy extraction and climate change on Gwich’in communities.

The GTG Department of Cultural Heritage; Gwich’in Social & Cultural Institute provides information on the Gwich’in peoples in Canada. The goal of the institution is “to conduct research in the areas of culture, language and traditional knowledge so that this body of knowledge would be recorded and available for future generations and the development of programs appropriate for Gwich'in needs.” Research projects have been carried out among contributions from Elders of the Gwich’in communities in Canada and the GSCI staff.

“The Gwich’in & The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge” discusses the efforts that the Gwich’in have made to prevent oil drilling in the 1002 area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). The 1002 area refers to a 1.5 million acre plot of land in the northern-most coastal plain of the ANWR, the only part of the 19 million acre ANWR that is unprotected by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA), established by President Carter in 1980. Section 1002 of ANILCA left these 1.5 million acres of land -- the primary calving grounds for the Porcupine caribou, which are sacred to the Gwich’in who rely on them for subsistence hunting and survival -- open to future oil and gas development. This source discusses the legislative and legal efforts that the Gwich’in have made to protect the 1002 area of the ANWR.
