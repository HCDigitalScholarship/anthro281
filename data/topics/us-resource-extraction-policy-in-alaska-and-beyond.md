* What is resource extraction?

**Resource extraction is the practice of removing natural resources from their intrinsic environments. Practices include, but are not limited to, oil and gas extraction, and coal and mineral mining.  Resource extraction policies are legislative and/or corporate policies that enable the practice of resource extraction. Since its inception, the United States’ expansion has been inextricably linked to resource extraction.**
