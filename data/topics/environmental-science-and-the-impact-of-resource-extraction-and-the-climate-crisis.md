# Why study ecological changes?

[Cumulative Environmental Impacts in the Gwich'in Cultural ...https://www.mdpi.com › pdf](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/11/4667/pdf)

* This study analyzes the cumulative environmental impacts in the cultural landscape of the Gwich’in Settlement Region in northern Canada. “The combined effects of intensified natural and anthropogenic disturbances are altering the structure and function of global ecosystems, with the potential to significantly impact the land-based livelihoods of many Indigenous groups” (1). The climate is warming more rapidly in the Arctic than in any other region on Earth, and industrial development, particularly in the form of oil and gas extraction, is increasing greatly; this combination of forces is severely threatening to Gwich’in livelihoods. 

# Ecological Changes

## Climate Changes and Caribou/the Gwich’in lifestyle

* The Alaskan arctic has been hit by climate change significantly harder than ecosystems with more moderate temperatures and weather conditions. As air temperatures continue to rise, soil and sea temperatures are also getting warmer, resulting in shifts in the types of organisms that the ecosystem can accommodate. The increase in global temperatures in Alaska is most closely monitored at the national parks and conservation sites, where most of Alaska’s Arctic parks experienced an air temperature increase of 3\*C, and a ground temperature increase of 1.5\*C since 2014 (2). As these areas continue to warm, the permafrost-underlain land found in the north of Alaska has begun to thaw, which has negative implications on both the soil composition, as well as land stability. When permafrost melts, the soil is left warmer and dryer than before, simulating conditions that are well-suited for forest fires and landslides, both of which serve to destroy the integrity of Alaska’s boreal forest. Presently, the boreal forest in Alaska houses black spruce stands, which, in turn, host the fruticose lichens that are an important winter staple in the caribou diet. Thus, a decrease in the density of the boreal forest therefore is inexplicably linked to changes in caribou migration patterns and herd survival: “caribou that spent the winters in areas with ample lichens fared better than the caribou that wintered in areas with fewer lichens” (3). Given that caribou constitute a large part of the Gwich'in culture and diet, changes in the caribou population directly impact Gwich’in traditions and lifestyles. 

## Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes

Permafrost and Caribou Patterns:

* This article describes the effects of climate change on the ecosystem of the Arctic, particularly emphasizing how as temperatures increase, the loss of permafrost also increases, and so does the loss of caribou habitat. The loss of the caribou habitat, as well as other aspects of the Arctic ecosystem, is a serious threat to the lives and culture of the Gwich’in.

* Air temperatures in the Arctic continue to rise on a yearly basis, despite hiatuses in warming elsewhere, globally. Climate change has dire consequences for many Alaska Native villages, including Gwich’in communities, who rely on subsistence hunting, fishing, and gathering for survival.

* This article discusses the impacts of increased forest fires in Alaska on Caribou survival and migration patterns. Increasing numbers of forest fires lead to younger forests with fewer fruticose lichens, an important winter food for caribou.

* This article contains testimonials from Gwich’in people on their experiences living in a community that is being irreparably damaged by climate change. The consequences of climate change have been seen by the Elders and youth in the community, particularly in weather, vegetation, and fish and caribou migration patterns.

Analysis of various environmental changes affecting Alaskan ecosystems due to climate change:

<https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/chapter/26/> 

* Fourth National Climate Assessment describes how continued climate change is threatening the marine and wildlife habitats that are vital to Alaska’s residents. It details ecosystem alterations that are difficult to predict and make adaptation more challenging, including ocean acidification, arctic sea ice retreat and thinning, permafrost thawing, increasing wildfires, and severe coastal and river erosion, among many other environmental changes.

# Anthropogenic/Industry Changes to the Ecosystem

## Primary Impacts of Regional Development

* Mining
* Road Construction
* Oil and gas extraction rigs

## Secondary Impacts of Regional Development

* Leaching of oil/gas components into the biosphere
* Noise pollution



The presence of industry and development in the Gwich’in Settlement Region in the Alaskan Arctic has amplified immediate anthropogenic changes, as well. More specifically, oil and gas extraction, resource mining, and construction in the northern regions all contribute to significant ecosystem instability. The land within the Gwich’in Settlement Region “represents a cultural landscape characterized by features linked to oral traditions and multigenerational land use,” which is now under threat by Western development (1). As a result of increased industrialization within the Gwich’in Settlement Region, the integrity of the Alaskan boreal forest and permafrost-ridden tundra is under assault: “The rapid encroachment of oil and gas, forestry and agriculture… has caused a reduction in habitat quality of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) through the fragmentation of the boreal forest landscapes by roads, seismic lines, and oil and gas wells” (4). When the boreal forest becomes weakened, the vegetation is younger, driving a shift in the types of organisms that coinhabit the landscape, which is generally less suitable for the persistence of the culturally-significant Porcupine Caribou Herd. As noted by Bernadette Demientieff, Executive Director of the Gwich’in Steering Committee, “The imminent oil and gas development will cause serious and irreparable harm to the Porcupine Caribou Herd and our way of life. We are caribou people and the caribou are essential to our health, identity, spirituality, culture, and our very survival” (5).
