# Why study ecological changes?

[Cumulative Environmental Impacts in the Gwich'in Cultural ...https://www.mdpi.com › pdf](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/11/4667/pdf)

* This study analyzes the cumulative environmental impacts in the cultural landscape of the Gwich’in Settlement Region in northern Canada. “The combined effects of intensified natural and anthropogenic disturbances are altering the structure and function of global ecosystems, with the potential to significantly impact the land-based livelihoods of many Indigenous groups” (1). The climate is warming more rapidly in the Arctic than in any other region on Earth, and industrial development, particularly in the form of oil and gas extraction, is increasing greatly; this combination of forces is severely threatening to Gwich’in livelihoods. 

# Ecological Changes

## Climate Changes and Caribou/the Gwich’in lifestyle

* The Alaskan arctic has been hit by climate change significantly harder than ecosystems with more moderate temperatures and weather conditions. As air temperatures continue to rise, soil and sea temperatures are also getting warmer, resulting in shifts in the types of organisms that the ecosystem can accommodate. The increase in global temperatures in Alaska is most closely monitored at the national parks and conservation sites, where most of Alaska’s Arctic parks experienced an air temperature increase of 3\*C, and a ground temperature increase of 1.5\*C since 2014 (2). As these areas continue to warm, the permafrost-underlain land found in the north of Alaska has begun to thaw, which has negative implications on both the soil composition, as well as land stability. When permafrost melts, the soil is left warmer and dryer than before, simulating conditions that are well-suited for forest fires and landslides, both of which serve to destroy the integrity of Alaska’s boreal forest. Presently, the boreal forest in Alaska houses black spruce stands, which, in turn, host the fruticose lichens that are an important winter staple in the caribou diet. Thus, a decrease in the density of the boreal forest therefore is inexplicably linked to changes in caribou migration patterns and herd survival: “caribou that spent the winters in areas with ample lichens fared better than the caribou that wintered in areas with fewer lichens” (3). Given that caribou constitute a large part of the Gwich'in culture and diet, changes in the caribou population directly impact Gwich’in traditions and lifestyles. 

## Ecosystem and Biodiversity Changes



Permafrost and Caribou Patterns:

* This article describes the effects of climate change on the ecosystem of the Arctic, particularly emphasizing how as temperatures increase, the loss of permafrost also increases, and so does the loss of caribou habitat. The loss of the caribou habitat, as well as other aspects of the Arctic ecosystem, is a serious threat to the lives and culture of the Gwich’in.

* Air temperatures in the Arctic continue to rise on a yearly basis, despite hiatuses in warming elsewhere, globally. Climate change has dire consequences for many Alaska Native villages, including Gwich’in communities, who rely on subsistence hunting, fishing, and gathering for survival.



“Caribou and Climate Change: The Nelchina Caribou Herd, Lichens and fire”:

<https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlifenews.view_article&articles_id=356>

* This article discusses the impacts of increased forest fires in Alaska on Caribou survival and migration patterns. Increasing numbers of forest fires lead to younger forests with fewer fruticose lichens, an important winter food for caribou. 



“Gwich’in Elders and Youth Speak on Climate Change in Arctic Village, Alaska”:

<https://www.culturalsurvival.org/news/gwichin-elders-and-youth-speak-climate-change-arctic-village-alaska> 

* This article contains testimonials from Gwich’in people on their experiences living in a community that is being irreparably damaged by climate change. The consequences of climate change have been seen by the Elders and youth in the community, particularly in weather, vegetation, and fish and caribou migration patterns.



Analysis of various environmental changes affecting Alaskan ecosystems due to climate change:

<https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/chapter/26/> 

* Fourth National Climate Assessment describes how continued climate change is threatening the marine and wildlife habitats that are vital to Alaska’s residents. It details ecosystem alterations that are difficult to predict and make adaptation more challenging, including ocean acidification, arctic sea ice retreat and thinning, permafrost thawing, increasing wildfires, and severe coastal and river erosion, among many other environmental changes.
